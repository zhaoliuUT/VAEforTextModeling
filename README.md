# VAEforTextModeling

Course project for Structured Models for NLP

- Use a CNN encoder and a Dilated CNN decoder (both 6-layered) to implement VAE text generation (packages needed: TensorFlow, Edward).
- Training data: 162k review sentences from Yelp (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download). Since the dataset is large, it is not included in this repo.
